# spectraClassification
Python repository for analysing spectra of SDSS objects.

## Current stage
The full dataset of spectra (about 4M) should be downloaded by now on the lofar machine.  
Currently I am looking at ways to identify the spectra and match them to the actual objects.  


## Updates
A script has been devised to match the spectra downloaded with the previous photometric data of the SDSS.
